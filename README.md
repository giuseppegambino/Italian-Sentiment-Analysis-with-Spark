# ItalianSentimentAnalysis
This is the project for my thesis in Computer Science done at University of Palermo under the supervision 
of the professor Roberto Pirrone.  

The main object was to build a data analysis pipeline with technologies related to Big Data:
  - Data collection    
  - Data pre-processing    
  - Data labeling    
  - Machine Learning model tuning    
  - Application of the Naive Bayes algorithm    
  - Model evaluation     
  - Insight extraction  
  
The technologies used are:     
  - Python 3.7    
  - Tweepy, Twitter API    
  - Pandas, Python Data Analysis Library    
  - NLTK, Natural Language Toolkit Library    
  - Apache Spark 2.4     
  
The project consists of 4 python pages of code:    
  - tweetSave.py to collect the tweet, is set to collect italian tweet with music keyword    
  - tweetClean.py to clean and pre-process the data    
  - tweetSentiment.py to label the tweet with positive, negative or neutral sentiment    
  - tweetSpark.py to apply the machine learning tools (RUNS ON SPARK)  
  
Write me if you have doubts or to improve the solution.
